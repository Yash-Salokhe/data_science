    I bought this washing machine in 2021 and have been using it for over 1.5 yrs without any issues. however recently it started making noise as the drum was hitting the side of the body. Called up service center and it took them more than a week and a few follow up calls to send their engineer. He saw the video that I had taken and immediately confirmed that suspension had gone bad. The machine comes with 3 suspensions and I was surprised to find that all three suspensions had gone bad. The suspension look very slim and I am not sure if they would last more than 2 yrs again. He mentioned that possible reason for suspension to go bad so soon, could be mixed load. For example along with bed spreads adding a few towels, shirt etc. We generally don't do that, also we went for a higher capacity washing machine, however it takes less than capacity quoted. If you want 5 kgs of clothes to be washed, please buy washing machine with a capacity of 10Kg. The machine is super silent and removes dirt very well. However I have doubts on long term reliability. As a reference our earlier Bosch lasted for almost 21 yrs

    excellent product bought from Amazon. I got a delivery very next day and whenever you buy a product such like refrigerator, washing machine, TVs and you live on the third floor. Fourth floor second floor. So make sure check the product downstairs if it in  case the product is damage like dents and broken, scratches on it,so you can return it from the downstairs.

    This Machine is exactly , what you heard about, robust, heavy duty but still almost noiseless. the only BUT is installation service offered by Amazon, though the over process is well designed and hand held, you will receive regular updates on the visit timings. But this installation is just vanilla, I mean I requested them to bring along Stand for the washing machine, but they were not equipped and then I called Bosch , there I was informed that I could have requested Installation from Bosch itself. So I would recommend to not opt for this installation if you are in metro cities and go ahead with Bosch installation.

    It's been six months working amazing. Low noise and vibration , just be cautious the machine should be level properly for log life as all machine needed to taken careof for vibration ,also always open the door for 20-30min after wash to keep the moisture out. Totally Worth it üëçüëç

    Excellent product. Highly recommended. Only issue is Bosch should improve the installation service. Initially had some issue but was later resolved after contacting the company.
